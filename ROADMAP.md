# ExecPlus Delivery Roadmap

Statuses are limited to `Complete`, `In progress`, `Planned`, and `Frozen`. A phase becomes complete only when its exit criteria are demonstrated by automated checks or an explicitly recorded operational review.

## Planning and product-positioning guardrails

- The September 2026 delivery window prioritizes the core product and activation capabilities allocated to Phases 1 through 3, plus enabling work for the export, metering, and billing capabilities in Phases 4 and 5. Full growth, commercial-hardening, and integration capabilities remain sequenced behind their required security and data foundations.
- A capability listed in this roadmap is planned scope, not evidence that it is implemented, production-ready, or included in a customer plan.
- Conversational analytics cannot begin until workspace isolation, upload validation, and deterministic profiling pass the Phase 1 acceptance criteria.
- ExecPlus may describe verified descriptive analytics and, after Phase 4 acceptance, limited basic time-series forecasting. It must not advertise full predictive or prescriptive analytics.
- Advanced forecasting, scenario planning, anomaly detection, and prescriptive recommendations remain frozen until the core product, evaluation, security, and approval-workflow gates pass.

## September 2026 delivery focus

The monthly focus is organized as dependency-ordered vertical slices. Unfinished scope carries forward without weakening an acceptance gate.

1. Secure activation foundation: organization and user workspaces, team invitations, isolated CSV and Excel upload, a guided upload wizard, sample datasets, column identification, data-quality validation and scoring, and traceable cleaning and mapping.
2. Descriptive analytics activation: recommended dashboards, KPI cards, trends, filters, drill-down, natural-language questions, management summaries, saved analyses, saved questions, prompts, and finance, sales, inventory, and HR KPI libraries.
3. Retention and commercial foundation: sharing, scheduled email reports, usage metering, customer usage analytics, feedback capture, in-app onboarding, exports, subscription management, payments, billing, and plan upgrades.

The phase definitions below remain authoritative for implementation order and completion evidence.

## Phase 0 — Engineering foundation

**Status:** Complete  
**Completed:** 2026-09-02

## Phase 1 — Secure ingestion and profiling

**Status:** Planned

Scope:

- Authentication, organization and user workspaces, workspace membership, and team invitations.
- Configurable seat limits from 3 to 50.
- Workspace-isolated dataset metadata, upload records, object storage, and audit events.
- Guided upload wizard for single-table CSV and single-sheet Excel files up to 20 MB.
- Versioned finance, sales, and inventory sample datasets that contain no customer or secret data.
- Clear rejection of multi-sheet files, merged cells, unsafe formats, and size violations.
- Automated column identification and deterministic profiling for row count, column count, inferred types, date ranges, dimensions, metrics, and semantic tags.
- Data-quality validation and a reproducible quality score covering missing values, duplicates, type conflicts, invalid dates, and unsupported structures.
- Previewable, reversible basic data cleaning and column mapping with source-to-output lineage.
- In-app onboarding for workspace creation, invitation, sample-data exploration, and first upload.
- Usage-event foundations for uploads, storage, seats, and profiling activity without recording uploaded row values.

Exit criteria:

- Cross-workspace access tests prove isolation.
- Parser fixtures cover valid, malformed, oversized, multi-sheet, and merged-cell inputs.
- Profiling results are reproducible for fixed fixtures.
- Cleaning and mapping tests prove the original upload is retained and every transformation is reconstructable.
- Quality-score fixtures produce stable results with actionable explanations.
- A non-technical user can create a workspace, invite a teammate, upload a supported file, and understand its profile.

## Phase 2 — Verified conversational analytics

**Status:** Planned

Scope:

- Curated semantic definitions and join-path representation.
- Finance, sales, inventory, and HR KPI libraries with versioned definitions, required fields, units, and validation fixtures.
- Finance, sales, and inventory dashboard templates backed by those governed KPI definitions.
- Intent router for numerical, textual, unsupported, and ambiguous questions.
- Read-only SQL planning, parsing, validation, cost limits, timeout limits, and DuckDB execution.
- Clarification guard for competing metric or dimension mappings.
- Multi-turn thread state using structured references rather than raw prompt history alone.
- Natural-language questions, suggested questions, and reusable prompt starters derived from the authorized profiled schema.
- Answer assembly and AI-generated management summaries from executed rows and authorized evidence only.
- Descriptive dashboards with KPI cards, trend analysis, filters, and permission-aware drill-down.
- Automated dashboard recommendations derived deterministically from profile and KPI compatibility.
- Saved questions, prompts, dashboard configurations, and analyses scoped to a workspace and owner.
- Permission-aware links for saving and sharing analysis within a workspace.
- Calculation lineage and complete audit trail.

Exit criteria:

- Golden question suites return exact expected values.
- Prompt-injection tests cannot bypass read-only or tenant constraints.
- Ambiguous and unsupported questions never execute a query.
- Each numerical answer can be reconstructed from stored lineage.
- Dashboard cards, trends, filters, and drill-down values match the underlying executed results.
- Management summaries cannot introduce a number absent from executed evidence.
- KPI-library and dashboard-recommendation fixtures are deterministic and explain why each recommendation applies.
- Shared analyses cannot be opened outside their authorized workspace or role.
